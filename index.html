				<p><b>A CUNY Student Edition</b> is a high-quality peer-reviewed digital edition of a historical text offered to the public at no cost. CUNY Student Editions are designed to meet the needs of a diverse body of students and instructors with textual notes and an introduction. Some editions include additional background material, critical responses, and sources. Each CUNY Student Edition is edited by a community of scholar-students through an open peer-review process that makes editorial intervention easily discoverable.</p>

				<p>Unlike a traditional critical edition which aims to create a “best text,” a CUNY Student Edition embraces the fluidity of texts and historical publishing practices. The two main goals of the series are to work towards diversifying the curriculum by giving wider access to formerly obscure, uncirculated, or variant texts and to provide instructors with easy-to-adopt, open-access editions of canonical texts.</p> 

				<p>CUNY Student Editions are published with <a href="https://github.com/ManifoldScholar">Manifold</a>, an open-source publishing platform allowing web-based reading and social annotation. CUNY Student Editions are also available for download as an open access EPUB file and from <a href="https://github.com/CUNY-Student-Editions">Github</a>.</p>
